# GAIA-X Self-Descriptions

This repository contains the self-descriptions of the GAIA-X core ontology. As language the [DTDL standard](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) is used. This standard is based on [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/) and offers an easy way to use the DTDL without required knowledge about RDF.

Currently, the ontologies for the following types are supported:

- Data Assets
- Providers
- Service Composition
